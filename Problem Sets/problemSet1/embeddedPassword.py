'''
The letters of a secret password have been embedded, in order, in an alpha-only string at index numbers N, 2N, 3N ... N42 where the value of N starts at 4 and
increases until the string can no longer support N*2. Index numbers start at 1. The criteria for the password are:

-The first and last characters of the password must be uppercase.

-The password must contain at least three vowels, which can be either uppercase or lowercase.

-If the password has an odd number of characters, the middle character of the password must be a vowel (A/a, E/e, I/i, O/o, or U/u).

-If the password has an even number of characters, the middle two characters of the password must be the same vowel, and must both be either uppercase or lowercase.

Write a function that, given a string, will print all possible passwords embedded in the string that meet these criteria. For example, if the string passed in is

â€œzzzAEzzazPzazzIWzzzCzzzzE", the output should be:

AaaW EPICE

Note that Aaaw is the password when N=4 and EPICE is the password when N=5.
