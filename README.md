# Daily Problems

Just a repo for a fun small problem a day. Mostly written in Python.

Problem is stated in comment at the top of each file.
Folders will have the code file, test case file, and/or diagrams that I used to solve the problem.

Started on June 30th, 2020, and have done one every day. (early commits were not attached to my github account)

Any suggestions/improvements, feel free to let me know :)
